# Sandbox Dashboard 
This is a sample app that was created with the Using _Square's REST APIs to build a sandbox Dashboard_ tutorial series. Read the associated blog posts to learn more about the operation and construction of the code. You should note that this code is for illustrative purposes only, and uses anti-patterns (like exposing access tokens to the client) that you should never do in production.
